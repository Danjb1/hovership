## Game Concept Planning

### Hovership Modules :wrench:

**Manipulator** - the tool on the bow
- Grabber/claw
- Magnet
- Grappling hook
- Taser
- Drill

**Hull** - the colour of the ship's surface
- Armour
- Shield (invulnerable but transient)
- Heatshield (reflective)
- Waterproofing

**Engine** - the colour or particle effect of ship's trail/glow
- Double jump
- Turbo boost
- Jetpack
- Glide
- Flight

Levels will contain checkpoints at which the player can swap modules.
Modules can be found while playing through levels.

### Collectibles :gem:

Hovership needs power shards. These are floating geometrically-regular crystals
which the player will find throughout the levels.

They can be used to buy cosmetic customizations for the ship.

The value of a power shard is denoted by its number of vertices, where each
shape has a distinct colour.

### Levels :sunrise_over_mountains:

The current thinking is having one large level for each theme.
This has the advantage of making it easier to hide secrets.

**Themes**
- Castle
- Floating islands
- Sci-fi city full of neon
- A large spaceship
- Rugged mountains
- A factory or big facility

There could be a fast-paced, soaring level between each themed level.
This would add to the notion of a journey, i.e. of Hovership going somewhere.
These soaring levels would have a high FoV, with a greatly increased ship speed.

### Obstacles :no_entry_sign:

Levels will contain obstacles which can be overcome with the clever use of modules.

**Examples**
- Flamethrower
- Laser turret
- Moving platforms
- Electrified grids
- Submerged sections
