# To Do

 - Fix player physics

    - Player sometimes can't jump properly

    - Player doesn't collide with obstacles

    - Smooth out hover motion (currently twitches)

 - Add unit tests

 - Player rotation should have some acceleration to it

 - Use RequireComponent attribute?

 - Use virtual buttons

 - Improve documentation (e.g. include units)
