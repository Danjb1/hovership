# To Do

 - Player gets stuck when overlapping an object but raycast hits the ground

    - Use a trigger collider for ground detection?

    - Use a second rigidbody positioned underneath the player?

 - Player sometimes can't jump properly

 - Player vertical position is stuttery

 - Camera doesn't move vertically until player reaches the optimal vertical height

 - Player should return to optimal height faster

 - Add unit tests

 - Player rotation should have some acceleration to it

 - Camera should snap to player after respawn

 - Use RequireComponent attribute?

 - Use virtual buttons

 - Improve documentation (e.g. include units)
