# To Do

 - Air cushion can collide with multiple objects in one frame

 - If air cushion clips a block, upwards velocity is very high

 - Add unit tests

 - Fix rotational acceleration
  -- Acceleration should be much greater
  -- Move constants to PhysicsHelper

 - Use GetAxisRaw for forward/backward motion

 - Use RequireComponent attribute?

 - Improve documentation (e.g. include units)
