# To Do

 - Air cushion collision should find the highest contact point

 - Air cushion can collide with multiple objects in one frame

 - If air cushion clips a block, upwards velocity is very high

 - Air cushion should not collide with walls (player can climb walls!)

 - Add unit tests

 - Use GetAxisRaw for forward/backward motion?

 - Use RequireComponent attribute?

 - Improve documentation (e.g. include units)
