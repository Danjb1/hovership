# To Do

 - While player is grounded, camera should treat player as if at optimal hover height

 - Air cushion can collide with multiple objects in one frame

 - If air cushion clips a block, upwards velocity is very high

 - Add unit tests

 - Player rotation should have some acceleration to it

 - Camera should snap to player after respawn

 - Use RequireComponent attribute?

 - Use virtual buttons

 - Improve documentation (e.g. include units)
