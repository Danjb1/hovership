# Game Concept Planning

## Hovership Modules :wrench:

**Manipulator** - the tool on the bow
- Grabber/claw
- Magnet
- Grappling hook
- Taser
- Drill

**Hull** - the colour of the ship's surface
- Armour
- Shield (invulnerable but transient)
- Heatshield (reflective)
- Waterproofing

**Engine** - the colour or particle effect of ship's trail/glow
- Double jump
- Turbo boost
- Jetpack
- Glide
- Flight

One upgrade will be unlocked in each level, and these will be available permanently.

## Collectibles :gem:

Hovership needs power shards. These are floating geometrically-regular crystals
which the player will find throughout the levels.

They can be used to buy cosmetic customizations for the ship.

The value of a power shard is denoted by its number of vertices, where each
shape has a distinct colour.

## Levels :sunrise_over_mountains:

See [levels.md](levels.md).

Aim is to have one large level for each theme. Finding the key unlocks the next level.

Later these may be connected by fast-paced, soaring levels. This would add to the notion of a journey, i.e. of Hovership going somewhere. These soaring levels would have a high FoV, with a greatly increased ship speed.

## Obstacles :no_entry_sign:

Levels will contain obstacles which can be overcome with the clever use of modules.

**Examples**
- Flamethrower
- Laser turret
- Moving platforms
- Electrified grids
- Submerged sections
