To Do
================================================================================

 - Move camera smoothly in the y-axis when player lands
    - Almost there - fix problems in CameraController script
 - Re-engage player camera tracking when player falls below last grounded y
 - Reduce jump force (jump seems way too high now that camera is staying still)
 - Is friction being correctly applied in a framerate-independent fashion?
 - Limit velocity
 - Move physics constants to somewhere global
 - Use RequireComponent attribute?
 - Use virtual buttons
 - Improve documentation (e.g. include units)
