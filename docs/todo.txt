To Do
================================================================================

 - Turns out, real-world gravity is not fun! Let's reduce this and tweak the
    player's jump accordingly
 - Move physics constants to somewhere global
 - Use RequireComponent attribute?
 - Limit velocity
 - Use virtual buttons
 - Improve documentation (e.g. include units)
 - Don't jerk the camera upwards when the player jumps?
 - Is friction being correctly applied in a framerate-independent fashion?
