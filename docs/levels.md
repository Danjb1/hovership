# Levels

## 1. Sky Bastion

A castle atop a floating island.

The player starts the game with no abilities except for jumping. They start outside the castle walls facing a closed portcullis, with the keep in the distance. This area contains some houses, trees, a barn and a well. Power shards are scattered about, encouraging exploration. Jumping down the well takes the player to the castle dungeon.

Outside the player's cell, a cat mimics the player's movement. The player must use this fact to make the cat press a button, which opens the cell door. Once free, the player can go upstairs to the entrance hall.

Here, a door leads outside, but it is closed. The player must go upstairs and jump across the chandeliers to reach a balcony where the grabber power-up is unlocked. This can be used to move a crate onto a button, opening the front door to the castle.

## 2. Obsidian Grotto

A lava cave.

## 3. Neon City

A bustling metropolis at night.

## 4. Levitanium Forge

An industrial factory full of machines that become activated as the level progresses.

## 5. Mining Site K-12

A low-gravity level on a moon.
